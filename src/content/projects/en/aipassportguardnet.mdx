## Blockchain Safety Verification and Compliance for the Toy Sector

System based on **blockchain technology** for creating a **Digital Product Passport** in the toy sector, focused on product safety verification, regulatory compliance, and multi-stakeholder access for manufacturers, government agencies, and consumers.

### The Challenge

The toy sector faces growing regulatory demands on product safety and traceability. Manufacturers need to demonstrate regulatory compliance in a verifiable way, regulatory bodies need reliable access to product information, and consumers demand transparency about origin and composition. Fragmented and unverifiable information creates risks for all parties.

### My Role

As **blockchain and frontend developer**, I participated in:

- Implemented smart contracts and blockchain verification logic
- Developed the web interface for digital passport management
- Designed access workflows for multiple stakeholder types (manufacturers, regulators, consumers)
- Integrated security protocols for handling sensitive product information

### Technical Approach

**Blockchain verification:**

- Immutable storage of safety and compliance data for each product
- Complete traceability from manufacturing to end of lifecycle
- Cryptographic verification of information authenticity and integrity

**Multi-stakeholder interface:**

- Manufacturer panel: product data and certification management
- Regulatory body access: compliance verification
- Consumer portal: quick product information queries

**Security and privacy:**

- Security protocols for sensitive product information
- Data protection law compliance
- Data integrity guaranteed through blockchain

### Differentiation

Unlike DLT4AITOYS (which focuses on AI services for smart toys), AIPASSPORTGUARDNET focuses on **regulatory compliance and safety verification**, providing a trust infrastructure for multiple actors to verify product conformity in the toy sector.

### Collaboration

Project led by **AIJU** in collaboration with GAME MOVIL S.L., INDUSTRIA AUXILIAR JUEMA S.L., JUGUETES CAYRO S.L., and AEFJ (Spanish Association of Toy Manufacturers).

### Funding

Funded by the **Conselleria d'Innovació, Indústria, Comerç i Turisme**.
