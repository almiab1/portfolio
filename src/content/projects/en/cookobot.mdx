- **VueJS + Bulma**: Responsive web interface for remote control
- **TensorFlow**: Visual recognition of ingredients and utensils
- **Python Backend**: Business logic and real-time communication

### Features

- 🤖 **Remote control** via web interface
- 👁️ **Computer vision** for object recognition
- 📝 **Recipe assistance** with step-by-step guidance
- 📈 **Real-time monitoring** of status and telemetry

### Challenges Solved

- Integration of heterogeneous systems (ROS, web, ML)
- Bidirectional real-time communication
- TensorFlow model optimization for embedded hardware
- Multi-subsystem synchronization

### Result

Successful demonstration of robotics, AI, and web technologies integration to create a practical and accessible home assistant.
