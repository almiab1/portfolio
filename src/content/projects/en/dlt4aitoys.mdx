## Digital Passport for Smart Toys

Project developing a **digital product passport** for the toy sector, integrating **DLT (Distributed Ledger Technologies)** with **Artificial Intelligence** services.

### My Role

As a **developer**, I participated in implementing the digital passport system and integrating AI services.

### Project Objectives

The digital product passport enables:
- 📦 **Component control**: Registration of elements in a smart toy
- 🏭 **Traceability**: Tracking of manufacturing and distribution stages
- 🔍 **Identification**: Toy characteristics and origin
- ♻️ **Improved recycling**: Reverse logistics for circular economy
- 🌱 **Sustainability**: Reduced waste generation

### Multisectorial AI Platform

Enhancement and update of the platform integrating multiple AI services:

#### Artificial Intelligence Services
- **Image recognition**: Visual product analysis
- **Chatbots**: Conversational interaction
- **Sentiment and emotion analysis**: Natural language processing
- **Voice recognition**: Voice interfaces for smart toys

### Blockchain Technology (DLT)

Development of **Distributed Ledger Technologies** providing:
- 🔐 **Security**: Trustworthy information exchange
- 🔗 **Immutability**: Verifiable storage through cryptography
- 🌐 **Decentralization**: Distributed identity management
- 📊 **Traceability**: Permanent record of relevant information

#### DLT Innovations
- **Simplification**: Mechanisms similar to traditional databases
- **Learning curve**: Facilitated access for unfamiliar users
- **Self-sovereign identity**: Purely decentralized management
- **Database semantics**: Intuitive interaction with DLT networks

### Benefits for Toy Industry

- ✅ **Improved quality**: Smart toys with greater educational value
- 🔒 **Security**: Authentication and component verification
- 📈 **Transparency**: Reliable information about origin and composition
- 🌍 **Sustainability**: Alignment with circular economy
- 🎯 **Added value**: Market differentiation

### Collaboration

Project developed in collaboration between **AIJU** and **ITI**, combining expertise in AI and blockchain technologies.

### Funding

Funded by **IVACE** (Valencian Institute of Business Competitiveness) with co-financing from the **European Union** through the European Regional Development Fund.
