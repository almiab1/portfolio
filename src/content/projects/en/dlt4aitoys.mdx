## AI and Blockchain Convergence for Smart Toys

Platform integrating **Artificial Intelligence services** (image recognition, chatbots, sentiment analysis, voice recognition) with **DLT (Distributed Ledger Technologies)** to manage the complete lifecycle of smart toys.

### The Challenge

Smart toys incorporate complex technological components that need traceability throughout their entire lifecycle. Additionally, the industry requires accessible AI services (visual recognition, chatbots, emotional analysis) integrated into a unified platform, along with a distributed ledger system that simplifies blockchain interaction for non-technical users.

### My Role

As **AI services and DLT developer**, I participated in:

- Integrated image recognition and computer vision services into the platform
- Developed conversational chatbot and sentiment analysis interfaces
- Implemented DLT innovations to simplify blockchain network interaction
- Collaborated on the digital passport design for toy component registration

### Technical Approach

**Multisectorial AI platform:**

- Image recognition for visual product analysis
- Conversational chatbots for user interaction
- Sentiment and emotion analysis through natural language processing
- Voice recognition for smart toy interfaces

**DLT technology:**

- Distributed ledger for component and manufacturing stage traceability
- Simplified mechanisms with semantics similar to traditional databases
- Decentralized self-sovereign identity management
- Intuitive interaction with DLT networks for unfamiliar users

**Digital passport:**

- Component control for elements within smart toys
- Manufacturing and distribution stage traceability
- Reverse logistics for circular economy and recycling

### Differentiation

Unlike AIPASSPORTGUARDNET (which focuses on regulatory compliance and safety verification), DLT4AITOYS focuses on **integrated AI services and DLT accessibility innovation**, making complex technologies usable for the toy industry.

### Collaboration

Project developed in collaboration between **AIJU** and **ITI**, combining expertise in AI and blockchain technologies.

### Funding

Funded by **IVACE** (Valencian Institute of Business Competitiveness) with co-financing from the **European Union** through the European Regional Development Fund.
