## AI Platform for Precision Medicine

Research project developing a **comprehensive platform** for analyzing clinical data of brain tumor patients through **Artificial Intelligence algorithms**, enabling personalized diagnosis and classification.

### My Role

As a **researcher and developer**, I focused on:

- 🏗️ **Development and deployment** of the complete platform
- 🧠 **Research and development** of specialized AI models
- 🎯 **Training Deep Learning models** for medical analysis
- 🔬 **Scientific validation** of algorithms and results

### Key Features

- **Multimodal analysis**: Integration of clinical data, images, and omics data
- **Medical Deep Learning**: Specialized models for histological and radiological images
- **Omics processing**: Analysis of transcriptomics, epigenomics, and oncological genomics
- **Assisted diagnosis**: Automated brain tumor classification
- **Clinical interface**: Intuitive system for use by medical professionals

### Tech Stack

**Backend & ML**
- **PyTorch + Lightning**: Main framework for Deep Learning models
- **FastAPI**: High-performance REST API
- **PostgreSQL**: Database for clinical data storage

**Frontend**
- **React**: Modern and responsive web interface

**Infrastructure**
- Distributed training pipeline
- Model validation and evaluation system
- Sensitive medical dataset management

### Technical Challenges

- **Multimodality**: Effective integration of heterogeneous data (images, text, omics data)
- **Limited data**: Data augmentation and transfer learning strategies for small datasets
- **Medical privacy**: Compliance with healthcare data protection regulations
- **Explainability**: Implementation of interpretability techniques for clinical decisions
- **Clinical validation**: Metrics adapted to real medical context

### Impact

Platform that enables doctors and researchers to:
- Accelerate brain tumor diagnosis
- Identify new therapeutic biomarkers
- Personalize treatments according to patient profile
- Facilitate precision medicine research

### Funding

Project funded by the **Valencian Innovation Agency (AVI)** under file INNEST/2022/159, in collaboration with ISABIAL, FISABIO, AIJU, and The New Horizons.
