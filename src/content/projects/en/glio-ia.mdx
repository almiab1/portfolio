## AI Platform for Precision Medicine in Brain Oncology

A 24-month research project developing a **comprehensive platform** for analyzing clinical data from brain tumor patients through **Deep Learning algorithms**, enabling personalized diagnosis and automated classification.

### The Challenge

Brain tumor diagnosis requires integrating information from multiple sources: histological images, radiological images, clinical data, and omics data (transcriptomics, epigenomics, genomics). Medical professionals need tools that unify these heterogeneous data sources and assist in clinical decision-making, especially when dealing with limited datasets and strict privacy requirements.

### My Role

As **AI researcher and platform developer**, I led the complete technical development:

- Designed and deployed the full clinical analysis platform
- Researched and developed Deep Learning models specialized in histological and radiological images
- Implemented distributed training pipelines using PyTorch Lightning
- Designed data augmentation and transfer learning strategies for small medical datasets
- Developed explainability techniques for clinical decision support
- Scientifically validated algorithms with metrics adapted to the medical context

### Technical Approach

**Multimodal analysis:**

- Integration of clinical data, medical images, and omics data into a unified pipeline
- Specialized models for each data modality
- Processing of transcriptomics, epigenomics, and oncological genomics

**Backend and ML:**

- **PyTorch + Lightning** as the main Deep Learning framework
- **FastAPI** as a high-performance REST API for serving predictions
- **PostgreSQL** for structured clinical data storage
- Distributed training pipeline with automated validation and evaluation

**Frontend:**

- **React** for an intuitive clinical interface aimed at medical professionals
- Visualization of analysis results and predictions

### Technical Challenges

- **Multimodality**: Effective integration of heterogeneous data (images, text, omics) into a unified model
- **Limited data**: Data augmentation and transfer learning strategies to compensate for small datasets
- **Medical privacy**: Compliance with healthcare data protection regulations (GDPR, Spanish healthcare regulation)
- **Explainability**: Implementation of interpretability techniques so clinicians can trust model decisions
- **Clinical validation**: Evaluation metrics and protocols adapted to real-world medical context

### Results

The platform enables doctors and researchers to:

- Accelerate brain tumor diagnosis through automated classification
- Identify new therapeutic biomarkers from multi-omics analysis
- Personalize treatments based on the patient's molecular profile
- Facilitate collaborative research in precision medicine

### Funding

Project funded by the **Valencian Innovation Agency (AVI)** under file INNEST/2022/159, in collaboration with ISABIAL, FISABIO, AIJU, and The New Horizons.
