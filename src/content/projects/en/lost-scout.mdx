## 3D Puzzle and Exploration Video Game

Exploration and puzzle game developed in **Unity** with complete 3D modeling created from scratch in **3D Studio Max**, encompassing programming, game design, and 3D art.

### The Challenge

Designing and implementing a complete video game as an individual project, covering both mechanics programming and systems as well as the artistic creation of all 3D assets, levels, and ambiance. The challenge included achieving a cohesive experience that integrated free exploration with progressive logical puzzles.

### My Role

As **game developer and 3D artist**, I created the entire project individually:

- Programmed game mechanics, interaction systems, and puzzle logic in C#
- Modeled all 3D assets from scratch in 3D Studio Max (environments, props, scenarios)
- Designed levels with progressive challenges and environmental storytelling
- Implemented dynamic lighting system with post-processing
- Developed custom physics engine and checkpoint system

### Technical Approach

**Unity development:**

- **C#** for game mechanics, object interaction, and puzzle logic
- Custom physics engine for gameplay-specific interactions
- Checkpoint and progress saving system
- Dynamic lighting with post-processing for ambiance

**3D asset creation:**

- Complete environment and scenario models created in **3D Studio Max**
- Optimized interactive props for performance
- Lighting and ambiance system integrated with models
- Polygon optimization for balance between visual quality and performance

**Game design:**

- Varied logical puzzle system with progressive difficulty
- Wide environment exploration with hidden secrets
- Physics-based object interaction
- Environmental storytelling through scenery and objects

### Outcome

Complete project integrating programming, game design, and 3D art from concept to final product, demonstrating the ability to cover all video game development disciplines.
