## Hybrid AR/VR Gaming Experience

Immersive video game developed in **Unity** that combines **Augmented Reality** and **Virtual Reality**, exploring the integration of both technologies with seamless transitions between modes.

### The Challenge

Designing a coherent gaming experience that works in both AR mode (interaction with the real environment) and VR mode (full immersion), with smooth transitions that maintain gameplay continuity and controls adapted to each modality.

### My Role

As **immersive experience developer**, I designed and implemented:

- Developed game mechanics in C# on Unity
- Integrated ARCore for surface detection and tracking in AR mode
- Implemented VR headset support with motion tracking
- Designed the seamless transition system between AR and VR modes
- Optimized performance for mobile devices with GPU constraints

### Technical Approach

**Game engine:**

- **Unity + C#** for mechanics, interaction systems, and game logic
- **ARCore** for surface recognition and virtual element positioning
- **VR SDK** for virtual reality headset support with motion tracking

**Game modes:**

- **Augmented Reality**: Interaction with virtual elements overlaid on the real world
- **Virtual Reality**: Complete immersive experience in a 3D environment
- **Hybrid mode**: Seamless transition between AR and VR while maintaining game state
- Controls specifically adapted to each experience

**Optimization:**

- Resource management for mobile and VR headset compatibility
- Smooth transitions between modes without loading interruptions

### Outcome

Cohesive gaming experience demonstrating how AR and VR can complement each other in a single product, offering multiple ways to interact with digital content.
