## Neuroevolutionary AI for Games

**Bachelor's Thesis** developing an AI through **neuroevolution** for Magic: The Gathering, combining neural networks with evolutionary algorithms.

### Custom Framework

Self-developed system implementing:

- 🧠 **Neuroevolutionary algorithms**: Neural networks + genetic algorithms
- 🎮 **State evaluation**: Complex system for game positions
- 📈 **Adaptive learning**: Evolution across generations
- 📊 **Complexity metrics**: Quantitative environment analysis

### Tech Stack

- **Java**: Main framework
- **Groovy**: Automation scripts
- **Python**: Analysis and evaluation
- **Magarena**: MTG game engine

### Features

- Management of multiple evolutionary generations
- Parallel agent training
- Automated performance evaluation
- Detailed logging and metrics system

### Results

The AI demonstrated capability to **learn competitive strategies** and improve performance generation after generation, validating the applicability of neuroevolutionary methods in highly complex strategic games.
