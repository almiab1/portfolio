## Industrial Digital Transformation with 4.0 Technologies

An 18-month project focused on **implementing Industry 4.0 technologies** in real manufacturing environments, developing functional demonstrators integrating IoT, Virtual Reality, Digital Twins, Additive Manufacturing, and RFID.

### The Challenge

Manufacturing companies need to adopt digital technologies to improve productivity, quality, and sustainability, but the transition from traditional processes presents significant technical and organizational barriers. The challenge was to demonstrate the viability of these technologies in real industrial environments, not in laboratory settings.

### My Role

As **Industry 4.0 solutions developer**, I participated in implementing multiple technological demonstrators:

- Developed real-time IoT monitoring systems for industrial processes
- Implemented digital twins for simulation and optimization of robotic cells
- Integrated RFID systems for recyclable material traceability
- Collaborated on additive manufacturing solutions with conformal cooling

### Technical Approach

**Simulation and Digital Twins:**

- Industrial process simulation with virtual visualization of robotic cells
- Digital Twin generation in Virtual Reality to replicate real operations
- Identification of improvements and optimization of operational parameters

**Internet of Things (IoT):**

- Real-time monitoring of industrial process control and status
- Automatic defect analysis in produced parts (quality control)
- Pattern and anomaly analysis for data-driven decisions

**Additive Manufacturing:**

- Mold manufacturing through 3D printing
- Conformal cooling techniques to optimize injection cycles
- Deformation reduction through uniform cooling

**RFID and Traceability:**

- Recyclable material traceability using RFID technology
- Waste management and material location optimization
- Circular economy promotion from the manufacturing process

### Results

The project concluded with functional demonstrators validating the applicability of 4.0 technologies in real manufacturing, contributing to smarter production, environmental sustainability, data-driven decision making, and industrial process optimization.

### Funding

Project co-financed by the **European Regional Development Fund** and **IVACE** (Valencian Institute of Business Competitiveness).
