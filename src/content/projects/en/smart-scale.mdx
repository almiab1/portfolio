## IoT Weight Tracking System with Mobile App

IoT system integrating **ESP32 hardware**, **Firebase Realtime Database**, and a **Kotlin Android application** for weight tracking with automatic cloud synchronization.

### The Challenge

Building a complete end-to-end IoT product: from the physical weight sensor to a mobile app with user profiles, history, and trend analysis. The challenge included reliable wireless communication between hardware and cloud, and instant data synchronization.

### My Role

As **IoT and mobile developer**, I implemented all product layers:

- Programmed the ESP32 firmware in C++ with weight sensors and WiFi connectivity
- Configured Firebase Realtime Database for instant data synchronization
- Developed the Android app in Kotlin with authentication and multiple profiles
- Implemented the automatic hardware calibration system
- Designed the history visualization and trend analysis features

### Technical Approach

**Hardware:**

- **ESP32** as microcontroller with high-precision weight sensors
- Bidirectional WiFi connectivity
- Automatic calibration and power consumption optimization

**Cloud:**

- **Firebase Realtime Database** for instant synchronization between scale and app
- **Firebase Authentication** for multi-user profile management

**Mobile app:**

- **Kotlin** for native Android development
- Weight evolution history and charts
- Customizable notifications and reminders
- Trend analysis and goal progress tracking

### Outcome

Functional and scalable IoT product demonstrating the complete integration of embedded hardware with cloud services and native mobile development.
