## Technology for Labor Inclusion of People with Asperger

Social impact project developing technological tools to improve **employability for young people with Asperger Syndrome** by combining **Artificial Intelligence**, **Virtual Reality**, and **digital educational resources**.

### The Challenge

People with autism spectrum disorder face severe exclusion in the workplace. Existing job preparation resources don't adapt to their specific learning needs: they require tools that respect individual pacing, allow repeated practice without judgment, and simulate real work situations in safe environments.

### My Role

As **AI and VR tools developer**, I participated in implementing the three main project tools:

- Developed the AI-based conversational chatbot for workplace question resolution
- Implemented Virtual Reality scenarios for work environment simulation
- Collaborated on the digital guide for active job searching
- Integrated natural language processing services into the web platform

### Developed Tools

**1. Active Job Search Guide**
Digital resource covering curriculum vitae preparation, interview techniques, job search strategies, employer expectations, and available support entities.

**2. woTICS Platform with Virtual Assistant**
Accessible web application with an AI-based intelligent chatbot that answers work-related questions with personalized responses and an interface designed for users with Asperger.

**3. Virtual Reality Scenario**
Immersive simulation of real work environments (offices, stores, workspaces) where users practice situations like the first day at work, colleague interactions, and conflict management in a consequence-free environment.

### Technical Approach

**Artificial Intelligence:**

- Conversational chatbot with natural language processing
- Specialized knowledge base in employment and social skills
- Adaptive response system that improves with use

**Virtual Reality:**

- Immersive 3D environments replicating realistic workspaces
- Simulation of workplace interactions with NPCs
- Multiple professional scenarios with progressive difficulty

**Web Development:**

- Application with universal design and accessibility as priority
- Interface adapted to the needs of users with Asperger
- Cross-platform access from any device

### Pedagogical Approach

- Respect for individual learning pace without time pressure
- Safe practice in a judgment-free environment
- Constructive feedback and guided learning
- Ability to repeat experiences multiple times

### Collaboration

Project developed by **AIJU** in collaboration with **ASPALI** (Association for people with Asperger Syndrome).

### Funding

Co-financed by the **Erasmus+ Programme** of the European Union.
